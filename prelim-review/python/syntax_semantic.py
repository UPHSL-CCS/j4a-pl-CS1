# Syntax errors occur when the written code violates
# the language's grammatical rules. This causes the code
# to fail execution, because the compiler/parser needs the right grammar
# in order to understand how to execute it.

x = 10
print x;

# If the code above is executed, it will result in an error.
# A correct print statement in Python written as print().
