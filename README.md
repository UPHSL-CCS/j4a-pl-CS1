## Coding Exercise: Syntax, Semantics, Lexical Analysis, Type Systems

**üéØ Objective**

    To reinforce basic concepts (syntax & semantics, lexical analysis, naming/scope, type systems) and connect them to later topics
 
**üìù Reflection**

1. What concept was most challenging in the activity?
   
The most challenging part we encountered in this activity was organizing our answers as a group and pushing our code to the repository. It took some time to coordinate and make sure each member‚Äôs work was properly added.

2. What tools did you use to complete the exercise?
   
We used the text editor Visual Studio Code for coding, Git for version control and collaboration, and programming languages like Python and C# to demonstrate the concepts.

## Coding Exercise: Control Flow and Expressions

**üéØ Objective**

    To explore and compare control flow constructs and expressions across programming languages.
 
**üìù Reflection**

1. What concept was most challenging in the activity?

The group as a whole is less familiar with C#, so creating the programs for loops, if-else, and expressions was harder at first.

2. Enumerate the differences in how each language handles control flow.

In conditionals (if-else): the two languages are very similar. Python uses if-elif-else, as well as indentation to define the structure and hierarchy, while C# uses if-else if-else, and relies on {} to denote hierarchy.

There is also a different way of doing conditions, which is switch/match, which we hadn't used. In more recent versions of Python, there is match case, while C# natively supports switch case.

Loops are similar to each other syntax-wise, with both for loops and while loops present. A minor difference is that C# uses counters in for loops, while Python does the for loop using an iterable, like a range, list, or a string.

Loop control is similar, in that break and continue are both implemented. In Python, it is possible to add an else clause to fulfill an additional action.

We also haven't used it, but exceptions/error handling is similar, at least on the surface. Python uses try/except/finally, where we can use multiple excepts to handle different errors. C# uses try/catch/finally.

As for expressions, Python, which uses and/or/not among other things is more easily readable compared to C#, which has &&/||/! as equivalents.
